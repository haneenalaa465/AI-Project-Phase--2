# Reinforcement Learning Application for Task Scheduling (Phase II)

## Overview

This project extends Phase I, where various search algorithms were applied to solve a task scheduling problem. In Phase II, we model the same problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task and implement Q-Learning to optimize task scheduling while adhering to constraints and dependencies.
